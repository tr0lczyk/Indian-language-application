Miwok App
===================================

Appliaction that shows words translation from english to Indian Miwok Language - made as a part of the Google Udacity Android challenge. It's a multiscreen app with an ArrayList, ArrayAdapter and custom object's class. To build this app I also used the MediaPlayer API and AudioManager, so the user can hear the pronunciation of each word/statement. Now I'm working on adding the fragments pager adapter to make navigating through the app  smoother.
